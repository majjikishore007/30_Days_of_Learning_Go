## Notes 


- Dependency Injection is a design pattern by which you inject(pass in) the dependencies or state to the function to use it instead of function creating the dependencies itself.

- In simple words, its like we give everything that a function needs to do its job, instead of the function figuring out what it needs to do its job.

- This just decouples the function from its dependencies, making it easier to test and maintain.

- If we can't test a function because it usually has dependencies that are hard-wired into it or global state
